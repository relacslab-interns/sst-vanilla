/**
Encapsulates a topology like torus, fat tree, butterfly which
has a regular, well-defined structure.  Routing on these topologies
is regular enough to be done with simple math computations without
resorting to a large routing table.  This contrasts with unstructured
topologies like #top_from_file where there is no regular structure
and routing must be done via lookup table.

The major defining characteristic of a structured topology is
being able to define a coordinate system.  Each switch in the
topology has a unique number and that number can be mapped
to a unique set of coordinates.  A torus has an obvious
mapping of index to X,Y,Z coordinates.  A butterfly or fat tree
also has a well-defined coordinate system, but is slightly less intuitive.
