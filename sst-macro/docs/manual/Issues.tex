\section{Polling in applications}
\label{sec:polling}

Use of probe non-blocking functions in a loop, such as:


\begin{CppCode}
while(!flag){
 MPI_Iprobe( 0, 0, MPI_COMM_WORLD, &flag, &status );
}
\end{CppCode}
creates problems for the simulation. Virtual time never advances in the MPI\_Iprobe call. 
This causes an infinite loop that never returns to the discrete event manager. 
Even if configured so that time progresses, the code will work but will take a very long time to run.

\section{Fortran}
\label{subsec:issues:fortran}

\sstmacro previously provided some experimental support for Fortran90 applications. 
This has been discontinued for the foreseeable future.
For profiling existing apps written with Fortran, DUMPI traces can still be generated.
