\hline
arbitrator \paramType{string} & cut\_through & null, simple, cut\_through & Bandwidth arbitrator for PISCES congestion modeling. Null uses simple delays with no congestion. Simple uses store-and-forward that is cheap to compute, but can have severe latency errors for large packets. Cut-through approximates pipelining of flits across stages.  \\
\hline
latency \paramType{time} & No default & & The latency to traverse the component \\
\hline
bandwidth & No default & & The bandwidth of the arbitrator \\
\hline
credits \paramType{byte length} & No default & & The number of initial credits for the component. Corresponds to an input buffer on another component. In many cases, SST/macro can compute this from other parameters and fill in the value. In some cases, it will be required. \\
